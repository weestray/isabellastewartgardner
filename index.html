            <h3 id="introheader">Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston is known for its beautiful architecture and stunning art collection. But beyond this lies a legacy spanning over a century, beginning with the museum’s founder, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and culminating in the intrigue of the world’s most valuable art heist, which, to this day, is still unsolved.
            </p>

        <h2 id="biosectionlink">Who was Isabella Stewart Gardner? </h2>
        <p>Isabella Stewart Gardner was a Boston heiress, philanthropist, and patron of the arts renowned for her bold sense of style and unconventional behavior, which included:

          The gossip columns <em>loved</em> her. She once remarked, in response to a story about her:</p>

            <p> Isabella’s passion for collecting art began in the 1880s, sparked during extensive travels abroad with her husband, Jack. 
              They collected art everywhere from Europe to Asia; the works included stained glass, Renaissance art, Romanesque sculpture, and Chinese antiquities.
            </p>
          
            
            <p>Isabella and Jack’s art collection soon outgrew their house in Beacon Hill, so the couple decided to establish a gallery. However, Jack’s sudden death in 1898 left Isabella to carry their vision forward alone.</p>

        <h2 id="museumsectionlink">The Museum </h2>
        <p>With the help of local architect Willard T. Sears, Isabella’s museum – modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice – began construction in 1901.
             
        <div class="comparisongrid">

            </div>
          </div>
            <p> In 1901 and 1902, Isabella installed her collection of paintings, sculptures, tapestries, furniture, manuscripts, rare books, and decorative arts. 
              She was incredibly particular about every aspect of the museum’s construction and design, ensuring it reflected her taste. At the time, her museum – three stories tall –  was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.
      She continued to acquire works and change the installations for the rest of her life.
            </p>
        
        <blockquote>
          Gardner put it in writing that if anyone were to move anything, the museum would have to give everything to the MFA and shut down permanently.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The museum opened on January 1, 1903, with a celebration featuring champagne, donuts, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra – naturally.
Isabella filled her museum with artists, performers, and scholars. As a dedicated champion of artists and intellectuals, Isabella often used her museum to host lectures, concerts, and exhibitions.
        She surrounded herself with creative minds, many of whom were gay — an affinity that some interpret as early advocacy for LGBTQ rights.</p>
        <p>She passed away in 1924, leaving the museum “for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.” </p>
        <p class="segue">But the Gardner Museum's story was far from over. </p>

          <h2> The Robbery </h2>
          <div>
          <p>At 1:20 a.m. on March 18, 1990, a vehicle pulled up by the side entrance of the museum.</p>
           
          <p>Two men in police uniforms rang the buzzer, connecting them to a security guard, 23-year-old Rick Abath. Through the intercom, they explained that they were investigating a disturbance and must be admitted into the museum.
            Abath buzzed them in.
          </p>
         
        </div>

          
          <p>Within minutes, the “officers” had handcuffed Abath and the only other night guard. It is then that they said: </p>
          <blockquote>"Gentlemen, this is a robbery.”</blockquote>
    
          <p> The thieves wrapped duct tape around the guards’ heads and tied them up in the basement of the museum, rendering the guards incapable of notifying the authorities.</p>
        
          <p>Next, the thieves made their way through the museum.</p>

    <p> From the entrance, the thieves went directly to the Dutch Room on the second floor, where the best-known works were kept. Cutting and removing art 
      from frames, they began stealing works – including three Rembrandts. Next, they moved to the Short Gallery, on the same floor as the Dutch room,
      then to the Blue Room on the first floor.

  <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
    
      <p>The thieves took quite an impressive selection of art. Among the stolen works were:</p>
 
  
    <div class="stolenpainting">

      <div class="placard">
        <h4>"Christ In The Storm On The Sea Of Galilee"<br>
          <span>Rembrandt, 1633</span></h4>
        <p>A dramatic depiction of Christ calming the storm, this is Rembrandt’s only seascape.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="stolenpainting">
      <img id="cheztort" src="images/stolen/cheztortframe.png" alt="A framed painting titled 'Chez Tortoni,' depicting a man in 19th-century attire seated at a small table with a drink and paper.">
      <div class="placard">
        <h4>"Chez Tortoni"<br>
        <span>Édouard Manet, 1875</span></h4>
        <p>A refined portrait of a man sitting in a café, known for its impressionist charm.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="stolenpaintingv">
      <img id="concert" src="images/stolen/concertframe.png" alt="A framed painting titled 'The Concert' by Johannes Vermeer, featuring three figures in a quiet interior scene. A man plays a lute while a woman sings, accompanied by another woman at a harpsichord. The room is softly lit.">

        <span>Vermeer, 1663–1666</span></h4>
        <p>One of only 34 known works by Vermeer, this piece is valued as the world's most expensive missing artwork. This was also Isabella's first major art purchase, and she bought it without the help of experts. </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Before leaving, the thieves checked in on the guards – still handcuffed in the basement – and  asked if they were comfortable. How kind.

      They also made sure to stop by the security director’s office, taking the video cassettes that contained evidence of their entrance from the closed-circuit cameras as well as the data printouts from the motion-detecting equipment.
      
      The thieves left at 2:45 a.m. after making two separate trips to the car with their artwork.</p>
      <p>The guards remained handcuffed until police arrived at 8:15 AM. </p>

<h2>The Investigation</h2>
<p>The FBI immediately began investigating, but the thieves had covered their tracks quite well.
</p>

<p>A few witnesses – leaving a St. Patrick’s Day Party around 12:30 a.m. – briefly observed the thieves, believing them to be policemen due to their disguises. The guards and witnesses in the street described one thief as around 5 feet 9 inches in his late 30s with a medium build, and the other as around  6 feet, in his early 30s with a heavier build.</p>

  <figcaption>Police sketches of the two suspects, both with and without mustaches. (Source: The Boston Globe)  </figcaption></figure>


<p>Think carefully. Does this look like your Boston-based grandfather or uncle who has a small room in his house that he’s really cagey about?</p>


  <h3>Some Suspects</h3>
  <div class="cluegrid">
  <div class="clue">
    <div class="cluecard">
      <img src="images/cluecards/8.png" id="rick" alt="A mock game card in the style of Clue that depicts Rick Abath.">

      <h4 class="suspectname"> Rick Abath, Security Guard (night of theft)</h4>
      
        <ul>
          <li>Recent music school dropout who took the job at the museum to make ends meet while focusing on his band, Ukiah (Grateful Dead-inspired)
          </li>
          <li>Investigated for “suspicious behavior” and small details the night of the robbery – and because many museum heists are inside jobs</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <span>Verdict:</span> Later on, an FBI agent said he was too incompetent to have pulled it off, which is certainly one way of saying he was innocent.

      </div>
     </div>
  <div class="clue">
    <div class="suspectcard">
    <h4 class="suspectname">Whitey Bulger, Mob Boss</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>One of the most powerful crime bosses in Boston during the era
      </li>
      <li>Some theorized that he stole the art to help the Irish Republican Army raise money for arms</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Verdict:</span> Bulger was not responsible, but he actually tried to figure out the culprit of the heist himself. Since the crime was committed in his area – and without his permission – he wanted to be paid tribute.
  </p>

    <div class="suspectcard">
    <h4 class="suspectname">Brian McDevitt, Con man</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>A con man from Boston who plotted a very similar art heist to the Gardner Museum theft a decade earlier in New York </li>
    <li>This attempted heist involved him hijacking a Federal Express van; however, he failed to account for rush-hour traffic and didn’t make it to the museum before it closed for the night</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Verdict:</span> No involvement with the Gardner Museum heist, although he did tell an ex-girlfriend he had been asked to pull off the theft. (He was a career liar, so this doesn’t mean much.) </p>    </div>  
  </div>
</div>

  <p>
    All of these leads turned cold, and not a single arrest was ever made.
    <em>No one has seen the art since,</em> despite the $10 million reward offered by the museum for the items’ safe return.
  </p>
  <p> You might be wondering what someone can even do with a multi-million dollar painting. After all, it’s not like you can display it in the center of your living room, unless all your relatives and guests are a) blind or b) devoid of a moral compass.

  <div id="whattodo">
  <h3>What you can do with a stolen painting</h3>
    <ul id="paintingtut" >
    <li><span>Sell the art to a shady collector or dealer.</span> The downside for a thief is that the going rate for a stolen work (according to Forbes) is somewhere in the range of 3-10% of the piece’s actual value,
      and better-known pieces go for less.
    </li>
    <li><span>Extort money</span> from the museum itself – or a private owner or insurer who really wants their painting back. This is a tactic called art-napping, which involves high-profile, unsellable pieces and requires a broker to navigate the fine line between legal and illegal dealings. 
    </li>

    <li><span>Use it as currency for weapons and drug deals.</span> It’s comparatively easier to move a small painting than a large suitcase of cash across borders.</li>
     <li><span>Throw it out, destroy it, or return it to the gallery. </span>Seriously. This happens. For example, in 2003, three works by Picasso, Van Gosh, and Gauguin were stolen from the Whitworth Gallery in the U.K., and the thief left them in a public toilet a few days later.
    
    </li>

<h2>What Doesn’t Quite add up</h2>
  
<h4>Some more food for thought:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li> While the art they took is quite valuable, <span>they passed up far more valuable works</span>, including the museum’s most expensive piece, "The Rape of Europa" by Titian. Why would they skip this piece? Some experts say it's because the painting was too large.
      <img src="images/questionmark.png" alt="a question mark" id="qmark">
      Or perhaps they were working for a collector with a very specific taste.
    </li>
    <li>While they cut out the paintings – without much care – they <span>left one of the frames sitting in the security room</span>, instead of in the room it was taken from. What’s more surprising is that the motion detector never went off in this room.</li>
<li> The thieves <span>wasted valuable time attempting to remove a Napoleonic banner,</span> which was of little worth. However, in the process, they successfully took a bronze eagle attached to it, which currently has its own separate $100,000 reward.
  Investigators explored possible ties to the Corsican mob after reports emerged that stolen paintings were being offered for sale in France. Given the art’s connection to Napoleon (who was born in Corsica), it seemed plausible that the theft was linked.</li>
  </ul>

<p> 
  The FBI has said that they believe the artwork moved through organized crime circles to Philadelphia, but the trail went cold around 2003.
  Authorities have also identified a few people of interest – all associated with organized crime – whom they believe to have had information about the art’s whereabouts; unfortunately, all of these people are now dead, and none of them gave up any information about the fate of these paintings. 
  </p>

  <p> In recent years, a few leads have popped up but none have brought authorities to the art. Often, the 
    museum and the FBI have received tips from people who believe they’ve spotted the painting in Zillow listings, though these have all turned out to be reproductions.

  <h2>Summing Up</h2>  
<p>


People with information should contact the museum, which is offering a $10 million reward for anyone who provides information leading directly to the safe return of the stolen works. 
The statute of limitations on all crimes related to the theft has expired, and the museum promises confidentiality.

</p>

<p>The frames that held the missing artwork have sat empty since the robbery, and you can visit them today.</p>
